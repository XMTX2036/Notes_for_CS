## Lecture2 Program Analysis

> What are some **tools** that we can use to find mistakes in C/C++ codes? What are their limitations?

### Dynamic Analysis

===> High Level

**Tools**

- Valgrind

- LLVM Sanitizers

  - AddressSanitizer

    > Finds use of improper memory addresses: out of bounds memory accesses, double free, use after free

  - LeakSanitizer

    > Finds memory leaks

  - MemorySanitizer

    > Finds use of uninitialized memory

  - UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer

    > Finds usage of null pointers, integer/float overflow, etc

  - ThreadSanitizer

    > Finds improper usage of threads

  - More ...

**Fundamental limitation of dynamic analysis**

Dynamic analysis can only report bad behavior that **actually happened**

### Static Analysis

- Basic static analysis ===> Linting
- Dataflow analysis

**Limitation**

- False positives

- Need to limit scope to get reasonable performance
