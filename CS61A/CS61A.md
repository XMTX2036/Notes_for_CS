  - Combining multiple ideas in large projects
  - How computers interpret programming languages

**Expression**

**Functions, Objects, & Interpreters**

## Lec2 Names

**Names, Assignment, and User-Defined Functions**

**Types of Expressions**

- Primitive expression:
  - Number/Numeral
  - Name
  - String

**Defining Functions**

```python
def <name>(<format parameters>):
  return <return expression>
```

**Calling User-defined Functions**

## Lec3 Control

**Print and None**

**Pure Functions & Non-Pure Functions**

- Pure Functions

  Just return values

- Non-Pure Functions

  have side effects

**Miscellaneous Python Features**

**Statements**

A statement is executed by the interpreter to perform an action

**Conditional Expressions**

```python
<consequent> if <predicate> else <alternative> 
```

## Lec4 Higher-Order Functions

**Choosing Function Names**

- Names should convey the meaning or purpose of the values to which they are bound. 

- The type of value bound to the name is best documented in a function's docstring. 
- Function names typically convey their effect (print), their behavior (triple), or the value returned (abs).
